## Suicide Rate Analysis
The dataset compiles information from four distinct sources to explore correlations with increased suicide rates among various cohorts globally, covering a wide socio-economic spectrum. It consists of data from 1985 to 2016, integrating the Human Development Index (HDI), World Bank GDP figures, and suicide statistics. Data preprocessing was performed, and heatmaps were plotted to identify significant correlations. Additionally, country and continent-specific analyses of suicide rates over the period were conducted to uncover trends and patterns. The overall trend of suicide rates was also plotted to provide a comprehensive view of how suicide rates have changed over time, informing suicide prevention efforts and offering deeper insights into the socio-economic factors influencing suicide rates.
